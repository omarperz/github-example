Introduction
At different moments in life we have to move to another place, call it country, state or city, we tend to look for a place that is near our school or job, but as a student I can say that is really convenient to have access to certain venues, a supermarket, cafeteria and such are examples of places I tend to visit. So I bring up the next questions:

Would it be possible to develop an analysis of a neighborhood near your school that complies with certain criteria?

And if such, would it be helpful to find a place to move in?
